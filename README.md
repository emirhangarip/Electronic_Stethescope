###  **OBJECTIVE**


- The main goal of this  project is to build an electronic stethoscope system to acquire the acoustic sound that is coming from various parts of the body and convert that sound to a digital signal. 


 - These electronic signals can be further processed and digitalized to transmit to a personal computer or a laptop by using Arduino.  These are MATLAB codes that we used in our project.

###  PROPERTIES 
1. These codes utilize Arduino to quickly fetch data via serial communication. 

2. The obtained signals from the lungs and heart are filtered using a Butterworth filter, then converted into sound. 

3. The frequency domain of the signals is observed and displayed graphically using the Fourier transform function.AddÄ±itionally, beats per minute (BPM)is Calculated . 

4. A user interface has been designed to allow users to dynamically change the cutoff frequencies of the signal filter, and BPM is monitored accordingly.
